# React + Docker V2 ðŸš€

In this directory, I'm going to **Dockerize** a **React-App**. But this will be different from the rest, I will be using the **Docker** `init` and the **Docker** `compose` to run the images. Also I will've a **compose.yaml** file which is the most important part of the **Docker** `compose`. This is what we will use to define multiple services for example in the **API** project. Using the **Docker** init, provides us with basic configuration and basic images we will need based on our project.
