# Hello World From Docker ðŸš€

This Docker file pulls **nodeJs** from **Alpine Linux Distro** and then use that to run my **JS** hello world script. Why **Alpine** you may ask? Well that's because **Alpine Linux Distro** is a relatively small **Linux Distro** so the build size of our **Docker Image** is small. Around **(115MB)** approx.
