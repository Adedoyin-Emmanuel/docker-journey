# Docker Journey ðŸš€

Yes, finally. I'm learning and using **Docker**. I've always heard of docker and to be honest. I loved it even though I had no idea what it does then. I've explored tons of **Open-Source** projects and I always see **Dockerfile** and to be honest, it sometimes scare me because I thought it was really hard top that, I didn't know what those commands does. Apart from that, My **PC** had **256SSD** storage space and I dual booted **Windows** with **Ubuntu** so I didn't want to lag my system by using **Docker** though I was wrong. You don't need to have a high spec system to run or even use **Docker**. I recently upgraded my PC to **512** so I said, why not try **Docker**. So here I am, learning and using **Docker**.

## Why Docker ? ðŸ¤”

Well apart from the fact that **Docker** helps solves compatibility issues, it provides a smooth developement workflow for building, testing and deploying applications. Uber for example said with **Docker**, onboarding new developers takes minutes instead of weeks. Even before learning **Docker**, I tried using it to run a **Postgresql** and it was awesome. I just pulled the image and then ran it in a container. I love the workflow. I also wrote a custom image for that application. [Taskade API](https://github.com/adedoyin-emmanuel/taskade-api).

## Learning Journey ðŸ’»

For this repo, I will use **Docker** on different levels, and I will be dockerizing the following

- A simple NodeJS script just to get my feet wet with **Dockerfile** syntax
- A React app with vite
- An API with a Database service. Postgresql to be precise and maybe mongoDB
- A fullstack application, Frontend, Backend and Database
- A Fullstack NextJs APP
- Since I'm also learning **C#**, I will try to see if I can run **C#** by pulling a **Dotnet** image and then running my **C#** **CLI** app there.
- I will also try it with **C and Python** just for the fun and to go beyond the videos I watched

By the end of that, I will be super confident about **Docker**, **Dockerfile** syntax, and **Dockerizing** almost any application.

## Resources ðŸ¥„

As usual, I used Youtube to learn. I will share the links below. I also read the **Docker** documentation to know more about **Docker**.
