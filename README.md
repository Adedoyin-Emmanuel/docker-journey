# Docker Journey ðŸš€

Yes, finally. I'm learning and using **Docker**. I've always heard of docker and to be honest. I loved it even though I had no idea what it does then. I've explored tons of **Open-Source** projects and I always see **Dockerfile** and to be honest, it sometimes scare me because I thought it was really hard top that, I didn't know what those commands does. Apart from that, My **PC** had **256SSD** storage space and I dual booted **Windows** with **Ubuntu** so I didn't want to lag my system by using **Docker** though I was wrong. You don't need to have a high spec system to run or even use **Docker**. I recently upgraded my PC to **512** so I said, why not try **Docker**. So here I am, learning and using **Docker**.

## Why Docker ? ðŸ¤”

Well apart from the fact that **Docker** helps solves compatibility issues, it provides a smooth developement workflow for building, testing and deploying applications. Uber for example said with **Docker**, onboarding new developers takes minutes instead of weeks. Even before learning **Docker**, I tried using it to run a **Postgresql** and it was awesome. I just pulled the image and then ran it in a container. I love the workflow. I also wrote a custom image for that application. [Taskade API](https://github.com/adedoyin-emmanuel/taskade-api).

## Resources ðŸ¥„

As usual, I used Youtube to learn. I will share the links below. I also read the **Docker** documentation to know more about **Docker**.
